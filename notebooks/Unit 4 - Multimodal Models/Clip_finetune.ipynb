        "[CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), or Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, is a multimodal model that combines language and vision to extract features from text and images. The resulting features are then projected into a common Euclidean space, allowing for meaningful comparisons between text and image features using the dot product.\n",

Consequently, fine-tuning CLIP diverges from the usual process, as seen in tasks like fine-tuning ResNet for classification. In our scenario, the model must acquire the most valuable features from both the input text and image data.\n",

        "Evaluating the quality of the features extracted remains an ongoing area of active research. One method employed for this assessment involves utilizing the extracted features to address the classification problem, either through the application of a [linear classifier probe](https://h2o.ai/wiki/probing-classifiers/) or adopting a zero-shot approach.\n",
